# Multiweb Distributed Computing using Python Selenium & Forth like Metaprogramming Script

__MWDC__ &mdash; comics fans might be hoping this is some kind of Marvel & DC cross over. It is Multiweb Distributed Computing. But still, we wish to convince readers that the magic of MWDC is no less than those of the greatest comics, as we believe MWDC may actually be the technological breakthrough needed to literally change the world. 

Although the number and capabilities of microprocessors shipped worldwide have grown tremendously over the past decade, the World Wide Web seems to have increasingly become centralized, prompting us to coin the term "uniweb" to refer to the single source nature of most web and mobile applications (web or mobile clients are restricted to retrieve data from a single server source, due to various "enforced conventions").

Against this backdrop, several innovative hacks (as we are happy to be able to call them just that) using Python Selenium demonstrated the possibility of "multiweb" &mdash; applications that can retrieve data from multiple sources, thus opening up new horizons for a truly ___DISTRIBUTED___ World Wide Web.


## Multiweb Demo: Reddit "Uncensorable" Anonymous Comments

We demonstrate an almost trivial example of multiweb, where [anonymous comments can be added to Reddit posts](https://github.com/udexon/Multiweb/blob/master/Reddit_anon_comment.md) (click [here](https://github.com/udexon/Multiweb/blob/master/Reddit_anon_comment.md)), by modifying the HTML DOM locally and storing the comments on a third party graph database server. It is trivial simply because of the number of comments that can be made by one anonymous commentator. It will no longer be trivial if this mechanism can be replicated over literally billions of user devices (desktop computers and mobile devices).

From the programmer's perspective, one of the crucial benefits of our approach is the deployment of a Forth like metaprogramming script, Phoscript, which acts as a universal script to interface to various programming languages used by the front-end (JavaScript), back-end (PHP) and Python itself. This can play an important role to popularize it amongst novice programmers, as they are now spoiled of choices to choose from no less than half a dozen of "essential" programming languages, before venturing into more specialized platforms. It also helps senior programmers to create a simplified, ___HYBRID___ API, where the caller script is written in Phoscript, while the callee function is in a host (native) programming language (e.g. Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, etc.) This will be most useful as the complexities of the applications increase, as the cognitive load to memorize more sophiticated code and data structure can be avoided, which is financially a non-trivial issue, especially when the software development team size increases.

Beginning with the Reddit "uncensorable" anonymous comment example above, amongst our short term and long term Phosway Multiweb A to Z goals, are the following:

1. Transient Key (Cryptography) Graph Database &mdash; PhosGraph

2. An ID-less Payment System &mdash; PhosPay

3. "Earn Money As You Learn" (EMYL) Tutorial Series, where trainers and trainees may earn online tips as little as USD1 using PhosPay

4. A Multiweb Instagram Ranking Database &mdash; Collecting Instagram data via crowd source user contribution

5. Social Media Online Tipping (e.g. Instagram, YouTube) etc. using PhosPay

The following is a series of tutorial articles on how we can incrementally develop the modules above using Phoscript, starting from scratch:
