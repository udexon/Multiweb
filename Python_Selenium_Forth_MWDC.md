# Multiweb Distributed Computing using Python Selenium & Forth like Metaprogramming Script

MWDC &mdash; comics fans might be hoping this is some kind of Marvel & DC cross over. It is Multiweb Distributed Computing. But still, we wish to convince readers that the magic of MWDC is no less than those of the greatest comics, as we believe MWDC may actually be the technological breakthrough needed to literally change the world. 

Although the number and capabilities of microprocessors shipped worldwide have grown tremendously over the past decade, the World Wide Web seems to have increasingly become centralized, prompting us to coin the term "uniweb" to refer to the single source nature of most web and mobile applications (web or mobile clients are restricted to retrieve data from a single server source, due to various "enforced conventions").

Against this backdrop, several innovative hacks (as we are happy to be able to call them just that) using Python Selenium demonstrated the possibility of "multiweb" &mdash; applications that can retrieve data from multiple sources, thus opening up new horizons for a truly ___DISTRIBUTED___ World Wide Web.
