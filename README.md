# Multiweb &mdash; Making the World Wide Web a Truly Distributed Computing Platform

- Imagine a global computer network whose primary traffic consists of billions of users accessing centralized clusters of servers owned by a handful of trillion dollars corporations.

- Imagine computing power (instructions per second, volatile and non-volatile memory) are now so cheap that a new computer typically costs less than a meal. 

Why are these users' CPU power not better utilized?

What if the centralized computing model above can be changed to a distributed model?

How can that be achieved?

In fact, the scenarios above are not imaginary. These are the realities of the World Wide Web today.

We would like to introduce the terms uniweb and multiweb to distinguish these two types of computing model, i.e. 

- Uniweb: single source centralized web;
- Multiweb: multiple sources distributed web.


Ever since the birth of the World Wide Web, the http protocol itself did not mandate that a web page needs to be restricted to a single source to retrieve its contents. This practice was established much later when uniweb (centralized) Internet traffic became more dominant, during the pre-mobile era, when users' computing power was much less compared to 2020. As computing power of user's devices (desktop computers and mobile devices) increases over the past decade, the uniweb model remained largely unchanged, although as we shall demonstrate, fundamental components to enable multiweb have matured during this time.


## Multiweb Demo: Reddit "Uncensorable" Anonymous Comments

We demonstrate an almost trivial example of multiweb, where [anonymous comments can be added to Reddit posts](https://github.com/udexon/Multiweb/blob/master/Reddit_anon_comment.md) (click [here](https://github.com/udexon/Multiweb/blob/master/Reddit_anon_comment.md)), by modifying the HTML DOM locally and storing the comments on a third party graph database server. It is trivial simply because of the number of comments that can be made by one anonymous commentator. It will no longer be trivial if this mechanism can be replicated over literally billions of user devices (desktop computers and mobile devices). 

The fundamental components to build a multiweb have already existed for the long time:

- transient key cryptography (established by Bitcoin and blockchain related projects)
- SSH tunnel (BitTorrent, Dark Net, Cryptocurrencies networks)
- graph database

These components just need to be integrated to create multiweb. In our own humble opinion, the most critical breakthrough lies in the application of transient key cryptography to create an ID-less graph database. This will then make SSH tunnel commercially viable, as individual users can then host their own data ON their own mobile or desktop devices, and begin to generate revenues from local businesses via [PhosPay](https://github.com/udexon/PhosPay), the most critical components of Phosway multiweb (click [here](https://github.com/udexon/PhosPay)). These will be the last hurdles to overcome and make it possible to turn every user device on Earth into a cloud server, ___literally inverting the original definition of cloud computing___.

Let us compare the Reddidt anonymous comment multiweb example to a Twitter user retweeting the same Reddit post. The latter may achieve a similar effect. However, if we generalize this scenario to social network Y sharing posts from social network X, we still arrive at the deadlock where the shared posts on social network X and Y are not searchable. Phosway multiweb then have all the necessary components to make such data searchable. It is a ___"universal super social network"___ which encompasses all other social networks.

The greatest excitement from the programmer's perspective is not even due to the commercial potential, but the technical breakthrough from uniweb to multiweb, which is analogous to transition from single CPU processing to true distributed parallel processing, yet again redefining the meaning of the legendary Sun Microsystems slogan, ___"the network is the computer"___.



## A Marxian Vision 2025

We did not intend this article to be a Marxian thesis at the beginning. It just turned out to be one as we contemplate what benefits multiweb can bring to the world in the next 5 years.

By Marxian, we do not mean to present a Marxist solution, but a solution that is perhaps as huge as Karl Marx intended. This is possible in 2020 because we now have technologies that can enable economic well being on a global scale without needing Marxist armed revolutions, as we shall explain.

Yet perhaps the technically correct term to describe our solution is the Chinese Taoist Wuwei 无为, perhaps unintentionally mapped to the Western term "anarchy", albeit an "orderly anarchy", a society that runs itself without interference by a central government. "Wuweiism" would convey the non-violent Taoist nature of this ideology, and rhymes with the subject of this article, the World Wide Web. 

To be specific, through PhosPay, one of the crucial components of Phosway multiweb, we aim to reduce the income gaps between MAGA+F (Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook) programmers and free software programmers.

If this goal can be achieved, then the next most immediately beneficial applications would be using Phosway multiweb to help everyone to learn farming and cooking, aided by robots developed by programmers paid using PhosPay.

Are these goals not clear and specific, and achievable within the next 5 years, a parliamentary term of the Westminster government?


### The Historical Roles of Chinese Secret Societies

To appreciate the significance of these goals, let us revisit Karl Marx's thesis, the historical background leading to Marx's writings, and their relevance today.

While most historians and economists may argue modern capitalism began with the industrialization in England, we propose an alternative hypothesis involving the secret societies of Han Chinese, whose business essentially powered the nascent global trade as the first Catholic Portuguese and Spanish traders began shipping Chinese teas, herbs and "china" (porcelains) globally in exchange of gold and silver nuggets mined from the then nascent colonies. The trade with China grew so big that Portugal and Spain literally became the first world superpowers of the modern times. Eventually the Protestant English and Dutch were able to carve out a piece of the pie, thanks to their more innovative approaches on commerce, perhaps most notably the establishment of the modern banking system based on interests, thought to be banned by the Catholics. 

Our focus in this article, however, lies on the role of individual persons, in the pre-modern societies, through the industrial revolutions, into the modern world. Marxist theories speak of the proletariat and bourgeoisie. The Chinese, however, presented an alternative role model, which escaped the attention of mainstream historians and economists.

- 山高皇帝远 We live high up in the mountains, where the Emperor is too far to be reached.

In our opinion, 3 historical events in China, shaped the characters of Chinese merchants and their roles during the birth of Capitalism:

1. The mass exile of Sung government officials and families to the South of China during the Mongols invasion in the 13th century. This has modernized the southern region of China and prepared her for the grand age of maritime navigation.

2. Zheng He's expedition in Asia and Africa, which further enhanced southern Chinese seafaring and commercial capabilities.

3. The Manchurian invasion of China, forcing the Han Chinese in the south to explore the outside world and establish perhaps the world's then biggest laissez faire economic system, which coincidentally powered (financed!!) the industrial and scientific revolutions in the West.

A thorough investigation into critical events since the 13th century is obviously beyond the scope of this article. We just wish to highlight that, Chinese secret societies, a term infamously made popular by the British colonial government, are the living proofs of how individuals may survive and thrive without government interference, the guiding philosophy behind Phosway multiweb. 


### Land Acquisition using PhosPay for the Next Farmers' Revolution

The previous section seeks to establish that Wuweiism is possible, with the so called legendary Chinese secret societies as living proofs. Non-Chinese readers may enquire about "Tin Tei Hui" or the Society of Heaven and Earth in any Chinese restaurant nearby to verify the pervasiveness of their networks, and of course their non-violent nature.  

Land ownership is one of the main goals of Marxist revolution. Although armed uprisings were necessary to carry out land ownership reform in the past, we would like to propose an alternative based on shared economy social media. 

Compared to 1950s, most countries in 2020 have basic education, mobile telecommunication networks and devices to access the Internet. Any country lacking the above can easily obtain loans or aid packages from China to establish them. As such, the most urgent priority for most people is no longer survival, but getting a decent job with a survivable income.

Although various shared economy social media apps claim to have helped create jobs, they were unfortunately not designed to systematically address the root causes of social problems. 

Take the latest trend in China for example, where literally thousands of heads of district governments went on live Internet broadcast to promote local agricultural and related products, post COVID19 lockdown.

Obviously a thorough analysis if the Chinese head of district government going live broadcast model can be replicated elsewhere is again beyond the scope of this article. What we would like to emphasize here is the following proposal:

1. Extending the Airbnb shared accommodation model to include cooking classes, so as to upgrade the skill sets of the individuals in the business;

2. Consolidate capital of individuals above to acquire farmland and venture into farming.

3. PhosPay can play a significant role in this as it can revolutionize online finance, facilitating borderless transactions by Investors from literally unknown corners of the Earth.

In summary, we are not advocating Marxist style land ownership reforms via armed revolutions. However, thanks to the pervasiveness of Internet and technologies, we can facilitate land acquisition by affected individuals in a truly borderless, and ID-less world, thus fundamentally improve the livelihood of populations much greater than any past Marxist revolutions may address.

Learn Chinese. Then more people can watch CCTV programs and learn first hand from China.

Airbnb + Cooking class. Then buy farm land. Close the loop.

Web page composition with data from multiple sources using Python Selenium

A new type of web browsing: multisource web (multiweb), vs. conventional single source web (Uniweb).

In the conventional monoweb, a web page is restricted to retrieve source code (HTML, JavaScript) from only one single source, for whatever reasons, which seem laughable when we understand how multiweb can be achieved.

Using Selenium (Python or Java based), the DOM of a web page can be modified locally, eg. a new comment from another source can be added to a Reddit post (or any social media).

This has huge demand, because Reddit is now famous for its censorship, even amongst American and international users, not Chinese.

Within the developer community of Selenium, few had talked about such local DOM modification, because of the same laughable reasons.

The breakthrough is with combining transient key cryptography and graph database, which makes alternative data source non trivial.

ie. Who cares if one person can add uncensorable comment to a Reddit post, which no body can see?

However, with TKC and graph database, millions of Internet users can anonymously store the uncensorable comments in their own mobile phone or home computers, accessible via shared VPS ssh tunnel, just like BitTorrent, but with additional applications, thanks to the ability of Phoscript to extend the functions of any network process with a few Forth words or tokens.

Then uncensorable comments become non trivial.

Multiweb can even work simultaneously on multiple social media, e.g. Facebook, Reddit, Twitter etc, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, making it essentially a "super social media", or simply "one universal social media".


and comment — need a global universal (distributed) graph database. Nature of universal database -- does not matter who hosts it, it will be shared and become part of a universal database.
