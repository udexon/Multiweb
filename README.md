# Multiweb

- Imagine a global computer network whose primary traffic consists of billions of users accessing centralized clusters of servers owned by a handful of trillion dollars corporations.

- Imagine computing power (instructions per second, volatile and non-volatile memory) are now so cheap that a new computer typically costs less than a meal. 

Why are these users' CPU power not better utilized?

What if the centralized computing model above can be changed to a distributed model?

How can that be achieved?

In fact, the scenarios above are not imaginary. These are the realities of the World Wide Web today.

We would like to introduce the terms uniweb and multiweb to distinguish these two types of computing model, i.e. 

- Uniweb: single source centralized web
- Mulweb: multiple sources distributed web


(Raspberry Pi etc.)


Distributed data first. Then distributed processing. 

This is a perhaps modest introduction to Multiweb, arguably the biggest breakthrough since, built upon several incremental innovations ....

Not included PhosCloud, BitTorrent type ssh tunnel and transient key cryptography + PhosGraph. Give Greeting with a Secret Phrase (GASP) article.

The http protocol itself did not mandate that a web page needs to be restricted to a single source to retrieve its contents. This practice was established ....

Multiple sources multi processing. Single source restricts processing. Source of data is the bottleneck. 

Distinguish user vs. client. User devices have improved tremendously in memory, storage and computing power ....

Distributed processing not keeping up with availability of computing power and data (more devices, power, more data, more users are connected) because of Uniweb restrictions. 

Web page composition with data from multiple sources using Python Selenium

A new type of web browsing: multisource web (multiweb), vs. conventional single source web (Uniweb).

In the conventional monoweb, a web page is restricted to retrieve source code (HTML, JavaScript) from only one single source, for whatever reasons, which seem laughable when we understand how multiweb can be achieved.

Using Selenium (Python or Java based), the DOM of a web page can be modified locally, eg. a new comment from another source can be added to a Reddit post (or any social media).

This has huge demand, because Reddit is now famous for its censorship, even amongst American and international users, not Chinese.

Within the developer community of Selenium, few had talked about such local DOM modification, because of the same laughable reasons.

The breakthrough is with combining transient key cryptography and graph database, which makes alternative data source non trivial.

ie. Who cares if one person can add uncensorable comment to a Reddit post, which no body can see?

However, with TKC and graph database, millions of Internet users can anonymously store the uncensorable comments in their own mobile phone or home computers, accessible via shared VPS ssh tunnel, just like BitTorrent, but with additional applications, thanks to the ability of Phoscript to extend the functions of any network process with a few Forth words or tokens.

Then uncensorable comments become non trivial.

Multiweb can even work simultaneously on multiple social media, e.g. Facebook, Reddit, Twitter etc, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, making it essentially a "super social media", or simply "one universal social media".

The greatest excitement is not even due to the commercial potential, but the technical breakthrough from monoweb to multiweb, which is analogous to transition from single CPU processing to true distributed parallel processing, redefining the meaning of the legendary Sun Microsystems slogan, "the network is the computer".
