# Multiweb
Web page composition with data from multiple sources using Python Selenium

A new type of web browsing: multisource web (multiweb), vs. conventional single source web (Uniweb).

In the conventional monoweb, a web page is restricted to retrieve source code (HTML, JavaScript) from only one single source, for whatever reasons, which seem laughable when we understand how multiweb can be achieved.

Using Selenium (Python or Java based), the DOM of a web page can be modified locally, eg. a new comment from another source can be added to a Reddit post (or any social media).

This has huge demand, because Reddit is now famous for its censorship, even amongst American and international users, not Chinese.

Within the developer community of Selenium, few had talked about such local DOM modification, because of the same laughable reasons.

The breakthrough is with combining transient key cryptography and graph database, which makes alternative data source non trivial.

ie. Who cares if one person can add uncensorable comment to a Reddit post, which no body can see?

However, with TKC and graph database, millions of Internet users can anonymously store the uncensorable comments in their own mobile phone or home computers, accessible via shared VPS ssh tunnel, just like BitTorrent, but with additional applications, thanks to the ability of Phoscript to extend the functions of any network process with a few Forth words or tokens.

Then uncensorable comments become non trivial.

Multiweb can even work simultaneously on multiple social media, e.g. Facebook, Reddit, Twitter etc, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, making it essentially a "super social media", or simply "one universal social media".

The greatest excitement is not even due to the commercial potential, but the technical breakthrough from monoweb to multiweb, which is analogous to transition from single CPU processing to true distributed parallel processing, redefining the meaning of the legendary Sun Microsystems slogan, "the network is the computer".
