This is a perhaps modest introduction to Multiweb, arguably the biggest breakthrough since, built upon several incremental innovations ....

The http protocol itself did not mandate that a web page needs to be restricted to a single source to retrieve its contents. This practice was establishedÂ ....

Figure 1 shows a Reddit post viewed by a user without logging in. We demostrate how the anonymous user may add a new comment, as displayed in figure 2. The user keyed in the comment in a text box (textarea) with a red 'PHOS' button at the lower right corner. The comment 'July 21 1250 le quick browne foux' is inserted as the first comment after the main post.

We shall describe the detailed mechanisms of how the above was achieved, before discussing various related issues.

1. A pop-up text box (HTML textarea within a form) is added to the DOM of the HTML page, by executing the commands listed in the following file via the browser console, as shown in figure 3 and 4:

2. As shown in lines 25 to 27 in `phos_comment_box.js`, the red 'PHOS' button will trigger an `alert()` window when pressed. 

```js
S[3].className='form-container btn'
S[3].style.backgroundColor='red'
S[3].onclick=function(){alert();}
```

We use this mechanism to notify the Python Selenium function `wait_alert()` as shown in figure 5, to retrieve the text entered by the user in the pop-up box, and store it via a HTTP POST web page in a remote PhosGraph server, as shown in figure 6:

This website acts a prototype for our graph database server, hence the name PhosGraph.
