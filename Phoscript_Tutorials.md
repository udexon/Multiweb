# Phoscript Tutorials

From the programmer's perspective, one of the crucial benefits of our approach is the deployment of a Forth like metaprogramming script, Phoscript, which acts as a universal script to interface to various programming languages used by the front-end (JavaScript), back-end (PHP) and Python itself. This can play an important role to popularize it amongst novice programmers, as they are now spoiled of choices to choose from no less than half a dozen of "essential" programming languages, before venturing into more specialized platforms. It also helps senior programmers to create a simplified, ___HYBRID___ API, where the caller script is written in Phoscript, while the callee function is in a host (native) programming language (e.g. Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, etc.) This will be most useful as the complexities of the applications increase, as the cognitive load to memorize more sophiticated code and data structure can be avoided, which is financially a non-trivial issue, especially when the software development team size increases.

- Phoscript, with its stack machine architecture and Reverse Polish Notation syntax, plays a key role in unravelling the secrets of transient key cryptography, and lays the foundation for a new paradigm in computing, with applications from graph database to a universal payment system.

The names of various modules associated with Phosway have gone through some changes over time. Readers are welcome to help use revise the older tutorials to update the old terms.

This page is an effort to organize all the Phosway related tutorials written in the past, so as to give readers, from non-programmers, novice to expert programmers, a quick overview and access. We shall update this page over time continuously. Readers are also welcome to help.

We believe Phoscript itself can have unprecedented impact to programming as an art, which we place as an equal to LISP in terms of functionalities and sophistication, with an ease to learn like Logo (a very old graphics programming language designed for children) or Lotus 1-2-3 (THE legendary spreadsheet program that inspired Microsoft Excel), while it can be learned and developed in conjuntion with ANY known programming language as it can be implemented as a shell cum interpreter within the host programming language. We believe this is the magic wand which Forth programmers have been looking for &mdahs; _to be implemented as a shell cum interpreter within the host programming language_ &mdash; to make Forth or any Forth descendant as popular as Python.

Ironically, PostScript and PDF, which we consider Forth descendants, has established itself as an ubiquitous platform, while few know of its origin.
